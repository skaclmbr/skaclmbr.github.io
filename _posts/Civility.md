Krista Tippet recently started a new segement on her podcast, [On Being](https://onbeing.org/programs/living-the-questions-6/), titled 'Living the Questions'. Most recently, she offered thoughts on this listener question:
>I have been hearing a lot of deconstruction of the word ‘civility.’ The debate around this word has become, like so many other things, binary. ‘Civility’ is either a tool of oppressors to silence those on the margins, or it’s something that is necessary for every single conversation and dialogue. I’d love to hear something about this word — what it actually means, in what contexts can it be helpful, in what contexts can it be used as a tool to silence anger.
