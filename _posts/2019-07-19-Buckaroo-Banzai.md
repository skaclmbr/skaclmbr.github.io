We all have childhood idols. Mine was Buckaroo Banzai - ably portrayed by the actor Peter Weller in a movie version of the comic. He was a neuroscientist, rock star, physicist, and overall cool person. He demonstrated kindness, attentiveness, and support without arrogance. He played guitar, mastered quantum physics, and walked through the world with curiosity, exploration, and a desire to understand. He embodied this purpose with bold action. He also had a loyal following of characters, some more skilled or powerful than others. Above all, he treated them like equals, fellow humans (or beings as the case may be).

These all sound like great traits to admire in a person - and clearly fictional. I wanted to be all of these things. A Jack-of-all-trades, without the master-of-none downside. 

Now I'm 47, and if I'm honest, BB is still my idol. Throughout my life, I've been invigorated by learning new skills and information. I love putting them together in new ways. I can program in python and javascript, build websites, manage a database, create complicated statistical and spatial analyses, identify songbirds by sight and sound, write grant proposals, manage large projects, supervise employees, play guitar, climb 5.10 routes, backpack, paddle a canoe, take quality photographs, be a caring father and husband, and demonstrate adaptive leadership principles. TBH though, master-of-all would be a serious overestimation.

Also, I like wearing bold colored shoes. 

Noble goals - noble aspirations, right? But when I look more deeply, I don't have a loyal following, and I wish I did. In my more embarrassing moments (sometimes in retrospection, and in likely unrecognized interactions), I long for the recognition of the breadth of my experience (but not so much the depth...). In a recent conversation with an admired colleague, I maneuvered the discussion so that I could fit in a recent accomplishment, a proud anecdote from one of my kids, and a recent good deed. Even more complicatedly, I revealed a recent mistake (but not a *really* bad one) in order to burnish my image of a supremely self-aware person who accepts their mistakes while reveling in their successes.

I've unsuccessfully applied to three new jobs in the past year. Part of the motivation is financial - I've got two kids on the verge of college - but I also long for more authority. I want to change the culture of our organization to work better. We are in the midst of a shift from an old guard to a new workforce and expanding constituency. At the same time, our old constituency is declining, and they are putting up a hell of a fight to stay on top. Won't authority help me accomplish this? Also, I would finally have that loyal following and complete the real world facsimile of my childhood idol. There is a forced recognition that my accomplishments are either not recognized or valued. "You're doing a great job with that project that I don't understand fully - keep it up". 

Do I need a position of authority to have a following? Even if I did, it wouldn't be BB's Hong Kong Cavaliers. They all chose to follow, and not because they were below him in an artificial chain-of-command. I also believe that true following are not built out of fear - and that the aspiration is not a following but a headless troupe, where everyone has valuable contributions according to their own nature. One is strong, capable of throwing others high into the air; one is light and nimble, capable of back-flips and other feats of acrobaticism; one might be skilled in combining strengths into a greater whole. But none are more or less important to the troupe as a whole - all dedicated to being the most inspiring display of athleticism possible. Striving for any of these positions degrades their combined strength. Finding, digging, discovering, refining your purpose is the one task that will have the greatest impact on success. 

BB didn't do all the things he did in order to build a following. He did them because they were part and parcel of his nature. He was true to his being, acting out of non-judgmental observation of his and others' behavior. And so my newest project of learning is to aspire to this most important lesson from BB - being true to myself, accepting and reveling in my true nature, and striving to continue this work until the day I die.

Time to put on the red chucks.
