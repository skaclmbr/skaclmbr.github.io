## Where are you going?

Awash. Unaware. Robotic. Trapped.

Trapped in my own vision of myself. 

On occasion, I get  the tiniest glimpse of the world. Dismaying and a very humbling. Dismaying because it briefly feels as if the veil is lifted, exposing the openness and revealing the self-imposed restrictions. 

I'm 47. No, 48 (hard to keep track). I'm developing a paunch from our household's relative affluence. I look at myself in the mirror more than I ever have in my life. We can go out to dinner more, afford more wine (and better wine), eat the really good food. A $60 dinner bill that was unthinkable 10 years ago is a monthly occurrence. We go on vacations that don't involve camping.

Yet, I am still stressed. I have two kids, who will start college soon. 

My ambitions are trite. I want to be a leader. I'm cautious. I'm failing. 

My favorite book is Cosmos.
